# Image-Segmentation

It is a project of Coursera Deep Learning Specialization's Course 4(Week - 3).

We do semantic image segmentation which allows you to predict a precise mask for each object in the image by labelling each pixel in the image with its corresponding class.

Using an U-Net ( named for its U-shape), a type of CNN designed for quick, precise image segmentation.
